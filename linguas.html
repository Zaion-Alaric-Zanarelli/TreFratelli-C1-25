    <h1> Cellar and Restaurant Tre Fratelli</h1>
    <p> Our story


Tre Fratelli has its roots in 1925, when Giovanni decided to cultivate Chiavennasca — the mountain Nebbiolo — on the terraces overlooking Tirano. Through economic crises, war, and the resurgence of alpine tourism, the family has upheld a simple tradition: wine, hospitality, stonework, and patience.
In the difficult years, the barrels were protected in a small “secret cellar” carved into the rock; during the recovery years, the grandchildren combined agricultural knowledge with oenological studies, never abandoning the dry-stone walls that hold the mountain.
Today, the fourth generation continues the family legacy with the same philosophy: good wine with good food, in a place that smells of wood, bread, and valley.


The cellar
Small, essential, carved into the stone. Controlled fermentations, aging in oak barrels, and long rest: the mountain demands time, and we respect it.
